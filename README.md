Empowering Early Breast Cancer Intervention with AI Imaging
# Abstract 
Breast cancer poses a global challenge, with increasing cases and limitations in current detection methods. To address this, our project leverages the power of AI imaging for early intervention. We aim to develop an AI-driven system that enhances breast cancer detection, assists radiologists, and tailors personalized treatment plans. By utilizing advanced techniques like deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we seek to improve accuracy, reduce false positives, and empower data-driven decision-making. Our vision is a future where technology and medical expertise converge to reshape breast cancer screening and care.
